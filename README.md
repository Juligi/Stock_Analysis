***# Stock Analysis & Refactoring Code for Improved performance.  ***

### Overview of Project:
This challenge requires practice of VBA utilizing starter code provided in this Challenge to refactor the original script, which looped through the data one time to collect all of the information. The key desired outcome is for refactored code to run faster than it did the original script.

Based on the explanations of Trilogy Education Services, refactoring is a key part of the coding process. When refactoring code, developers aren’t adding new functionality;instead the goal is to make code more efficient—by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read. 

### Analysis' Purpose:

The purposes of this analysis is to analyze ticker data for years 2017 and 2018.  The data consists of:
1. the stock's symbol or _ticker_ (12), 
2. __date__ when the shares were traded, 
4. the ticker's _open_ price
5. the ticker's  _high_ price
7. the ticker's _low_ price, 
9. the ticker's _close_ price, 
10. the ticker's _adjusted close _price, 
11. and the ticker's daily _volume_ of shares traded

The Analysis reviews the total daily volume and yearly return for each stock. Daily volume is the total number of shares traded throughout the day, measuring how actively a stock is traded. The yearly return is the percentage difference in price from the beginning of the year to the end of the year.
